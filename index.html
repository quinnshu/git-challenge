        <p>Squidward Tentacles is an anthropomorphic squid character in the Nickelodeon TV show "Spongebob Squarepants". He works with Spongebob at the Krusty Krab as a cashier. His defining characteristics are his gigantic, floppy nose and his hatred of all things silly and fun. However, despite his usual sour demeanor, Squidward has been known to indulge in his childish side and engage in diverionary entertainments with Spongebob and Patrick from time to time.</p>
